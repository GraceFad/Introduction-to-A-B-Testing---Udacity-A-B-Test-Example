# Introduction-to-A-B-Testing---Udacity-A-B-Test-Example

A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a process of showing two variants of a website, ad, email, popup, or landing page against each other to see which is most effective. It is a marketing strategy to check which variant drives more conversions. 
AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

In this case, we are testing the variation of the Udacity webpage where the "how many hours can you invest in the course" is introduced. Here:
- the background of the Udacity A/B test is briefly explained
- a sanity check is carried out
- the evaluation metric is selected and tested
- functions are created to carry out specific tests
- brief conclusion on the test results and how it affects the decision to be made
